# Table Tennis Tournament Generator App

This project is a desktop app specifically designed for generating tournaments of 4, 8, or 16 players.

A live version of the app can be found at - http://alex.developme.training/

## Getting Started

To get started, please clone a zip of the repository and install the prerequisites listed below.

### Prerequisites

Node Package Manager

The latest version of npm can be downloaded here - 

https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

```
Although this project does not use Node.js, please make sure you download the package that includes Node, 
as it is required for npm's file distribution.
```

You will also need a web browser to view the project. I reccomend Google Chrome -

https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html

Once you have both of these installed on your system, continue on to the next step.

### Installing

First unzip the project file, and navigate in your command line to the destination of the project.

Then navigate into the main file system. You should reach a folder that looks like this -

Make sure you are in the correct folder in yuor command prompt, if you ls you should see the package.json file.

Type the following command into your command prompt

```
npm install

or

npm i
```

This will install all the depndencies the project requires.

After that its simply a case of telling npm to run the program. 

Enter into your command line -

```
npm start
```

Congrats! The app should start up on its own now.
